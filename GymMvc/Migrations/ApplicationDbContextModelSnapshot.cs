Using two dumbbells and a bench, this exercise challenges the performer to lower both dumbbells to their chest before extending the arms to press them back up again. This bench press variation has an increased range of motion as the dumbbells can surpass the chest slightly.\r\n\r\nPrimarily targeting the chest muscles, the dumbbell press will activate the pectorals, triceps, and deltoids. The dumbbell bench press requires greater balance and stability so greater core engagement is needed.\r\n\r\nThe dumbbell bench press is great for beginners who want to build strength and stability before progressing to the barbell bench press, but equally valuable for intermediate and advanced lifters as a way to build unilateral strength and improve stability.\r\n\r\nThe dumbbell press can also be varied to regress the movement or add different challenges. For example, the neutral grip dumbbell press (palms facing each other) reduces involvement from the deltoids and places less stress on the shoulder joint, making it a suitable option for anyone wanting to focus on the chest and triceps while reducing injury risk, and the dumbbell floor press has a reduced range of movement which makes it suitable for beginners.\r\n\r\nThe dumbbell floor press has a reduced range of motion, making it a good option for beginners or those recovering from injury, while the alternating dumbbell bench press works shoulder and core stability more.",

Using the bench for support allows the torso to be at a 45-degree angle without relying on a hip hinge, which reduces the demand on the hamstrings and glutes and allows the back muscles to be challenged without being limited by lower body fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe incline dumbbell row targets the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, trapezius, and rear deltoids. A neutral grip (palms facing each other) is commonly used, which may feel more comfortable on the shoulder joint. However, you can choose to vary the grip to create more focus on different muscles. A supinated (underhand) grip places more challenge on the biceps, while a pronated (overhand) grip engages the lats further.\r\n\r\nThe incline dumbbell row is a good option for those new to the bent over row as the bench provides stability and the correct position to perform the movement while reducing the stress placed on the lower back. It can also help to improve muscular imbalances between the two sides as each side works independently.",

The squat can easily be adapted to suit your fitness level and abilities.\r\n\r\nFor beginners, the body weight squat, which is the most widely-known exercise would be a good one to start with.

Unlike squats, the leg press doesn't require any technical skill which makes it ideal for beginners too.\r\n\r\nThere are a few types of leg presses, with the most common being the 45 degree leg press and the seated leg press. The 45 degree leg press is the more challenging of the two as the plate is pushed at a 45 degree incline, and can have a higher weight as plates can be loaded on.

Key muscles targeted include gluts, quads, hamstrings, calves and core.\r\n\r\nKnown as a unilateral exercise, lunges work out one side of your body at a time. This helps improve your overall stability, giving your better coordination and balance to perform everyday activities.\r\n\r\nAnother positive of training one side of your body at a time is it allows you to ensure both sides of the body are getting an equal work out, rather than letting your stronger side do more of the work. \r\n\r\nLunges are particularly effective in giving your core muscles a work out as it takes some effort to remain upright as you perform the lunge. A stronger core will go some way to improving your posture and warding off lower back pain.\r\n\r\nAs the exercise targets large muscle groups, it can help give your metabolism a boost which will aid weight loss and tone up key target areas on your legs and bottom. \r\n\r\nBefore you plunge right in and give it a go, be sure to check out our top tips and our guide to performing some of our favourite lunges.
